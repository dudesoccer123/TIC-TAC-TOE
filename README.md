The game logic is integrated with a mysql database implemented using mysql connector module allowing to create users along with saving unique statistical data of the game.
To run the code mysql needs to be installed on the computer.
The login process and user creation process is validated to ensure data is entered correctly and the username and passwords match. 
The user data like username and passwords can be changed internally in the "Account Settings" section. The statistics for each logged in user can be viewed in the "statistics" tab. This is implemented using various mysql queries.
